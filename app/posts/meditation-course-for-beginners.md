## The 7-Day Practice (Detailed Overview)

### Introduction - Start Meditating Today

**7 Days to Inner Freedom**

Before diving into the daily practices, the introduction explains what meditation really is - and what it isn’t.

You’ll learn:

- Why many people struggle with meditation
- Whether you’re “meditating correctly” (and why perfection doesn’t matter)
- How just 2 minutes a day can already make a difference

The focus is on **starting simple**. Instead of forcing long sessions, you’ll learn how to build a habit that fits naturally into your life.

### Day 1 - Box Breathing

**Build a Strong Foundation**

Box breathing (also called square breathing) is one of the most effective techniques for calming the mind and stabilizing your emotional state.

On this day, you’ll learn:

- How box breathing works (equal inhale, hold, exhale, hold)
- Why this rhythm signals safety to your nervous system
- How to use it to reduce stress and increase clarity in just minutes

This practice becomes the foundation for the entire course. Once you understand box breathing, meditation stops feeling vague and starts feeling structured and reliable.

### Day 2 - Belly Breathing

**Feel Grounded**

Many people breathe shallowly into the chest without realizing it. This keeps the body in a mild stress response.

On Day 2, you’ll learn how to:

- Move your breath deeper into the belly
- Activate the parasympathetic (calming) nervous system
- Feel more grounded, stable, and present in your body

This practice is especially helpful when you feel anxious, restless, or disconnected.

### Day 3 - Full Breath

**Flush Your Body**

The full breath combines chest and belly breathing into one smooth, continuous movement.

On this day, you’ll experience:

- Deeper oxygenation of the body
- A natural release of physical tension
- A feeling of spaciousness and flow in the breath

This technique helps reset both mind and body and is ideal when you feel mentally overloaded or physically tired.

### Day 4 - Hand Posture

**Deepen Focus**

Meditation is not only about breathing - posture matters too.

On Day 4, you’ll learn:

- How hand position influences focus and stability
- Why small physical adjustments can deepen concentration
- How to create a more intentional meditation posture

This day helps you feel more “settled” and focused during your practice, even in short sessions.

### Day 5 - Inward Focus (Pratyahara)

Pratyahara is the practice of turning attention inward - gently withdrawing from external distractions.

On this day, you’ll learn:

- How to reduce sensory overload
- How to stop constantly reacting to sounds, thoughts, and impulses
- How to rest your attention inside instead of chasing distractions

This practice often brings a noticeable sense of mental quiet and inner space.
